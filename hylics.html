            <h2><strong>Story and Dialogue</strong></h2>
            <p>
            A strange aspect of Hylics is that its story is almost nonexistent,
            mainly caused by the game’s dialogue being randomly generated. NPCs
            will spout random strings of text that appear as though they have
            meaning, however, in reality they are meaningless. When talking to
            specific NPCs there is some premade dialogue, but most is simply
            nonsense.
            </p>

            alt=""
            />
            <p>
            You start the game as the main protagonist, Wayne, and are instructed
            to defeat the King of the Moon, Gibby. Other than this, there is
            little relevant explanation why Wayne must defeat Gibby or even go
            adventuring in the first place.
            </p>
            <p>
            You can add up to three other adventurers, but their reasons for
            joining you are shallow at best. This is not a bad thing as Hylics is
            a short game, beatable in under four hours. I feel as though deep
            exposition on the world and characters of Hylics would have detracted
            from its cryptic nature and possibly Hylics’ best feature, its art
            style.

            <h2><strong>Art</strong></h2>
            <p>
            The first thing I noticed about Hylics was the little red dragon icon
            that is used for RPG Maker, Hylics was made in RPG Maker VX Ace to be
            precise. I have played RPG Maker games in the past and mainly
            experienced the same/similar assets reused throughout all of them to
            some degree. This was not the case with Hylics.
            </p>
            <p>
            Except for a few weapon and equipment icons, Hylics has fully custom
            art. The enemies, attacks, abilities, and locations are all unique. It
            is refreshing to see this amount of effort expended on art when
            premade assets are so readily available.
            </p>
            <img
            src="https://neverendingrealm.com/wp-content/webp-express/webp-images/doc-root/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Hylics-Television.png.webp"
            alt=""
            />
            <p>
            Most or everything seen in Hylics is claymation. Enemies and objects
            within the world have all been animated using clay, making the world
            so much more interesting and dynamic than any RPG I have played
            before. Playing Hylics never felt like I was playing a game on the RPG
            Maker engine—a testament to how special this game truly is.
            </p>
            <p>
            My favorite pieces of art are the ability and item animations. They
            are incredible and peerless. My favorite animation is the juice box
            item. When used, a typical juice box appears in front of the player.
            It spins around and is crushed as if the player is sucking down the
            delicious juice with great ferocity. All items and abilities have
            these similar awesome animations, making each enjoyable.
