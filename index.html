        <h2>OFF the game Review</h2>
        <p>
            This game was created in 2008 in RPGmaker by Mortis Ghost and the team
            Unproductive Fun Time. Last year, the Reconstructed Game Team released
            an English language version available as a free download. It has been
            growing in popularity since then. A friend of mine, Edmund, recommended
            it to me. Tumblr user sterofab said, “This is a game that is defined by
            its atmosphere. It is a horror game that inspires not fear, but a
            painful sense of regret.” Something different. It seemed well worth a
            try.<br /><br />
        </p>

        <p>
            The game starts like a lot of RPGs: Enter your name. However, this isn’t
            the name you’ll be seeing on your battle stats or when people talk to
            your avatar in-game. The avatar is his own character, known only as the
            Batter. The name you enter is unique to you, the player, known to a
            select few characters who acknowledge your presence though they cannot
            see you. The Judge is one such character. This cat with the skull-like
            grin will give you a battle tutorial and intro to puzzles before sending
            you and the Batter off on a mission to purify the world of invading
            spectres, one zone at a time.<br /><br />
        </p>
        <p>
            I was excited about the opportunity to play
            <em style="font-size: 15px">Off</em> when I first heard of it. Having
            previously played other great titles coming from
            <em style="font-size: 15px">RPG Maker</em> like
            <em style="font-size: 15px">Lisa: The Painful</em> and
            <em style="font-size: 15px">Undertale</em>, it fit right into the niche
            genre of using unique RPG elements to tell a powerful story. My hopes
            were high for it to fall into this niche as I began to play the game.

            The game throws you right into a tutorial, showing you the ropes of the
            game. The in-combat menu is certainly something to take note of. You’re
            given the option to fight, either manually or automatically, and to flee
            the battle. Under the fight option, you can use basic attacks,
            competences, (which are special attacks), objects, (which are items you
            can use to heal yourself), and the flee option. When you select fight,
            you have a meter that slowly fills, allowing you to take your turn. As
            you gain more members in your party, it becomes more difficult to take
            your turn right as the meter bar fills. This is the non-traditional
            element that <em>Off</em> adds to the RPG element of the game. By
            managing your attacks faster, you’re able to maximize your damage, so
            keeping your items organised and knowing what your competences do is
            important for the most efficient combat.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once done with the tutorial, you’re thrown right into the story without
            being given much backstory. Upon entering the first zone, you’ll soon be
            met with the first of many puzzles in the game. These puzzles are
            satisfying to solve without being too difficult. I did find myself
            taking pictures and writing details down to solve some of them but that
            moment of “aha!” you have when you’ve finally pieced together the
            details needed to proceed is great. Given the small amount of control
            you have in the overworld, the creativity of these puzzles and the
            difficulty in figuring out what you need to do is amazing. In my
            experience, most games rev up the difficulty in their puzzles by
            introducing new controls to your character. Instead, this game manages
            to do that without adding any controls, instead making you pay close
            attention to the story. In my experience with playing RPGs, the puzzles
            present in this game are some of my favourites I’ve ever encountered.

            />The bosses in the game are a whole different story, though. It’s
            difficult to gauge the effectiveness of your party against them. The
            bosses seem to do so little damage against you but have massive health
            pools. Even though you can check their weaknesses, it’s often easier to
            just use brute force and speed rather than strategy. This leaves much to
            be desired when compared to other RPGs in the same genre. To add on
            this, the game has an absurdly high-level cap and allows you to keep
            learning moves that increase in power far past what you need. Even
            playing through the game rather quickly, I didn’t lose all my party
            members even once and hardly needed to stock up on items. Overall, the
            game could add some difficulty to its combat and still maintain its ease
            of play.

            The music and sound is nothing elegant, yet still succeeds in creating a
            matching atmosphere for the game. By the end of the game, I was
            exhausted from hearing the psychedelic, whispering track but it’s
            obvious that the music is only trying to clue you into something. Aside
            from the track, “A Stab of Happiness,” I can’t say I enjoyed listening
            to most of the music. Additionally, some tracks in the game don’t loop
            correctly, ruining the immersion. The soundtrack for this game is still
            great and characterises a tension that is needed to pull you along and
            make you continue to want more.
        </p>
        <p>
            Something else to notice is your conceptions of characters as you move
            throughout the game. One of the characters, The Judge, is nothing more
            than the annoying tutorial character at the beginning, one that you
            simply want to skip past. The way in which
            <em style="font-size: 15px">Off</em> utilizes its story development is
            magnificent in this way; as the game goes on, you start to sympathise
            with them and he even became one of my favourite characters by the end
            of the game. The story pulls you in and flips your expectations for the
            game on their head. I expected boring characters and out of touch
            dialogue when I first saw the game’s monochrome, almost lazy visual
            design but came to love how it misrepresented itself by the end of my
            playthrough. Overall, this original misdirection in the story leaves you
            constantly reevaluating how you view characters and really makes you
            feel like a part of the game, much like your inclusion as the character,
            “The Puppeteer,” would suggest.
